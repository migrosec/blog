I love to learn new things. As far as I can remember, I always wanted to understand how things worked around me (especially technology). As a kid I was fascinated by inventors who for me were like wizzards who uncovered the secrets around us. I always wanted to become one of those wizzards and leave a mark in this world. 

However, becoming a wizzard is really hard - and I am still trying to figure out in which area and especially how to get there. When I learn something new, I rarely feel like a wizzard, but more often rather like a joke (hello imposter syndrome :D) or put in other words, the more I learn about something, the more I know how less I truely know. Hence, the name of my blog `coderwiz` which kind of is an innuendo to either coder `wizzard` or `witz` ("witz" in german means joke). 

I always felt, that I had to become an expert at something first, before I am "allowed" to write about it or before people even find it interesting. So, I studied and read all I could on a topic, however I never got the feeling "to be ready" to share or write about what I learned. I never got the feeling of beeing a wizzrd, even though I put in soo much work, and spend so much time learing and reading. I learned that reading alone is not enough, since you can read all day about playing the piano, however this doesn't make you a good piano player, if any at all. 
After having read the book "Show your work" by Austin Kleon, I finally decided to break through my typical way of doing things and just start sharing what I learn and talk about it on the way no matter the consequences (even if it means no one is reading what I actually write about). And maybe one day, who knows, I also become a wizzrd in something... 

Having said that, welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I post about everything I find interesting - mostly related to programming, hacking and/or emacs. You ask why emacs, well simply because I like it. Currently, I love to think about and improve my (development) workflows and emacs gives me a ton of tools to do just that. For a reason I still trying to figure out, I am also interested in Common Lisp or LISPs in general - the whole developing in a REPL and homoiconicity got me intruiged. I am still a noob when it comes to either Elisp or Common Lisp, but I am already working on improving that. Other interests are programming in all sorts of languages my favorite being Golang at the moment. I also program my webapplication related projects in JavaScript (React) or do my data structures and algorithm studies in python. I think it is important to look at programming problems from different angles (think different programming language perspectives); otherwise every problem will become a nail, if your only tool is a hammer...

When life doesn't keep me busy with my two kids and wife, I try to put as much hours as I can into learning new things. In my day job I work as a penetration tester, during night I try to become a better programmer.

This blog mainly serves as my journal (or second brain) to keep track of my projects and share what I have learned. Maybe you also find something interesting or useful here. 
Anyways, welcome and please feel free to contact me at `michael@coderwiz.de` anytime in case you have any questions or just wanna chat.

Best regards,
Michael
