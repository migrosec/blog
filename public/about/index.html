    <p>I love to learn new things. As far as I can remember, I always wanted to understand how things worked around me (especially technology). As a kid I was fascinated by inventors who for me were like wizzards who uncovered the secrets around us. I always wanted to become one of those wizzards and leave a mark in this world.</p>
<p>However, becoming a wizzard is really hard - and I am still trying to figure out in which area and especially how to get there. When I learn something new, I rarely feel like a wizzard, but more often rather like a joke (hello imposter syndrome :D) or put in other words, the more I learn about something, the more I know how less I truely know. Hence, the name of my blog <code>coderwiz</code> which kind of is an innuendo to either coder <code>wizzard</code> or <code>witz</code> (&ldquo;witz&rdquo; in german means joke).</p>
<p>I always felt, that I had to become an expert at something first, before I am &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to write about it or before people even find it interesting. So, I studied and read all I could on a topic, however I never got the feeling &ldquo;to be ready&rdquo; to share or write about what I learned. I never got the feeling of beeing a wizzrd, even though I put in soo much work, and spend so much time learing and reading. I learned that reading alone is not enough, since you can read all day about playing the piano, but this doesn&rsquo;t make you a good piano player after all.
After having read the book &ldquo;Show your work&rdquo; by Austin Kleon, I finally decided to break through my typical way of doing things and just start sharing what I learn and talk about it on the way no matter the consequences (even if it means no one is reading what I actually write about). And maybe one day, who knows, I also become a wizzrd in something&hellip;</p>
<p>Having said that, welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I post about everything I find interesting - mostly related to programming, hacking and/or emacs. You ask why emacs, well simply because I like it. Currently, I love to think about and improve my (development) workflows and emacs gives me a ton of tools to do just that. For a reason I still trying to figure out, I am also interested in Common Lisp or LISPs in general - the whole developing in a REPL and homoiconicity got me intruiged. I am still a noob when it comes to either Elisp or Common Lisp, but I am already working on improving that. Other interests are programming in all sorts of languages my favorite being Golang at the moment. I also program my webapplication related projects in JavaScript (React) or do my data structures and algorithm studies in python. I think it is important to look at programming problems from different angles (think different programming language perspectives); otherwise every problem will become a nail, if your only tool is a hammer&hellip;</p>
<p>When life doesn&rsquo;t keep me busy with my two kids and wife, I try to put as much hours as I can into learning new things. In my day job I work as a penetration tester, during night I try to become a better programmer.</p>
<p>This blog mainly serves as my journal (or second brain) to keep track of my projects and share what I have learned. Maybe you also find something interesting or useful here.
Anyways, welcome and please feel free to contact me at <code>michael@coderwiz.de</code> in case you have any questions or just wanna chat.</p>
<p>Best regards,
Michael</p>
<p>&ndash; Before I forget, <code>Apple</code> if you ever read this, I would LOVE to work for you, so feel free to contact me any time for a job offer :D.</p>
